## 👤 Professional Background — From Emergency Response to Security Operations

I am transitioning into **Cybersecurity / Security Operations (SOC)** after **15 years working in frontline Emergency Care (SUS — Porto Alegre, Brazil)**.

Throughout my career in urgent and high-risk environments, I operated under:

- Critical decision-making scenarios  
- Limited resources  
- Time-sensitive escalation  
- Strict procedural compliance  
- High accountability  

I am fully accustomed to working in **12/36 and 12/60 shift rotations**, maintaining performance, focus, and structured communication during extended operational cycles — a model directly aligned with **24/7 SOC environments**.

Today, I am formally building my technical foundation through:

🎓 **Systems Analysis and Development (ADS)**  
FADERGS — Porto Alegre (in progress)

My objective is to apply my operational discipline and crisis management experience to **Cybersecurity**, specifically in:

- SOC Tier 1 (N1)
- Blue Team Operations
- Detection & Response
- Log Analysis & Incident Documentation

## 🔄 Transferable Operational Skills (Healthcare → SOC)

| Emergency Care | Security Operations (SOC) |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Rapid risk triage | Alert triage (first-pass analysis) |
| Severity prioritization | Incident severity classification |
| Crisis response | Incident handling & escalation |
| Handoff between shifts | Ticket documentation & structured escalation |
| Protocol adherence | SOP-driven security operations |

The core mindset remains the same:
**Assess → Prioritize → Document → Escalate → Monitor**

## 🛡️ Current Focus — SOC Tier 1 (N1)

### 🔎 Alert Triage
- Validate log source and detection rule  
- Identify repetition and attack patterns  
- Assess potential impact  

### 🪵 Log Analysis
- Windows Event IDs: 4625, 4624, 4688  
- Extraction of IoCs (IP, username, host, event_id)  
- Regex-based parsing  

### 📋 Incident Documentation
- Evidence-based reporting  
- Clear severity rationale  
- Ticket-ready notes  
- Escalation to Tier 2 when required  

### 🧩 Basic Correlation
- Failed → successful authentication mapping  
- IP → user → host validation  
- Baseline behavior comparison
