# Executive Summary

This assessment enumerates a home LAN subnet to identify active assets and exposed TCP services,
then maps observations to NIST CSF functions and proposes actionable hardening steps.

**Primary improvement areas**
- Router management hardening (disable HTTP / enforce HTTPS)
- IoT segmentation (guest network/VLAN)
- Introduce monitoring (Wazuh + Suricata)
